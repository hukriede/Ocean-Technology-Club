# Mote's Ocean Technology Club 

a new program that will allow Sarasota and Manatee-county high schoolers and
teachers to learn and apply science and technology skills through the mentorship
of marine researchers at Mote.


The selected student and teacher members will explore oceanography, physics,
chemistry, electronic circuitry and computer programming through real-world
examples and applications — from deploying monitoring devices in local 
environments to working closely with Mote scientists using robotic gliders 
to monitor for harmful algae.
